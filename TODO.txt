3 [ ] Ground Plane grid
4 [ ] 1+ Adjustable, 3-jointed, 4-segment 3D shape
      [ ] 4 sequentially joined segments
      [ ] 4 segments connected by 3 joints
      [ ] position adjustment from user input/event handling
5 [ ] 4+ Multicolored shapes
      [ ] objects not connected
      [ ] uses at least 3 vertex colors 
      [ ] blending with WebGL to get smooth pixel color transitions
6 [ ] 3D Axes
      [ ] world axes
      [ ] some Model axes
7 [ ] 4 Viewports that adjust to resolution/zoom
      [ ] one 3D scene in 4 viewports (2x2 grid)
          [ ] fixed orthographic views of the front
          [ ] fixed orthographic views of the top
          [ ] fixed orthographic views of the side
          [ ] 3D pespective image 
              [ ] mouse controlled viewing direction
              [ ] mouse/keyboard controlled viewing position
8 [ ] View control
      [ ] enables users to explore 3D scene via event handling
      [ ] camera allows movement from one 3D location to another (straight path!)
      [ ] camera must be able to smoothly pivot viewing direction without changes to 3D position
      [ ] camera must be able to smoothly move to any other 3D location without changing orientation
9 [ ] Switch 3D cameras
      [ ] in 4th viewport, let users switch between orthographic/perspective camera without changing the position/direction
      
Extra Credit 
[ ] Adjustable camera [asymmetric left/right/top/bottom edges]
[ ] Multiple Vertex Buffer Objects [different shapes in each]
[ ] "Flying airplane" navigation control
    [ ] forward velocity
    [ ] roll
    [ ] pitch
    [ ] yaw
[ ] "Trackball" control of one object [mouse drag changes the onscreen orientation
